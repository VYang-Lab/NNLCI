These figures are CPU inference outputs from `best_model_sod_final.pth` and
the packaged Sod fields. They visualize **CFD-informed fidelity lift**. They
contain no measured wall-clock or FLOP comparison.

## Read the comparison

![Sod P1.25 density overlay and signed error against HF](sod_P1.25_density_overlay.png)

The amber baseline is **LF1 (50 points)** interpolated onto the 800-point
grid. The teal NNLCI prediction uses **both LF1 and LF2 (100 points)**; the
dark HF curve is the supplied 800-point reference. The lower panel subtracts
HF point by point, exposing local differences that a full-field overlay can
hide. It is a density error profile, not a conservation or stability test.

![All six packaged prediction pressures](sod_pred_density_sweep.png)

Axes are shared across cases. The CFD generator uses training pressures
1.0–5.0 in increments of 0.5. P1.25, P2.25, P3.75, and P4.25 are distinct
prediction pressures inside that range; P5.50 and P6.00 are outside it.
This describes the supplied case construction, not independent verification
of every checkpoint's training history or generalization to other flows.

## Artifacts and provenance

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Triptych](sod_P1.25_fidelity_lift_triptych.png) | LF1, NNLCI, HF on shared position/density axes |
| [Permanent strip](sod_P1.25_fidelity_lift_strip.png) | Static comparison available with or without animation |
| [Density arrays](arrays/) | `x.npy` and P1.25 LF1, NNLCI, HF; each has 800 values |
| [Source hashes](provenance.json) | Checkpoint/raw-data SHA-256 hashes, case list, transforms, library versions |

When memory permits, regeneration also writes
`sod_P1.25_fidelity_lift.gif`: three comparison frames of the same physical
case, **not time evolution or iterative solver steps**. Primary Markdown
images use permanent PNGs so low-memory regeneration never breaks the page.

The renderer mirrors [Sod prediction preprocessing](../../../problems/1d_sod/src/prediction/predict.py):
linear LF alignment, training-LF1 z-score statistics, two three-point
stencils, and LF1 values at the first/last prediction points. HF is loaded
for comparison, not as a network input. Density is shown here; inspect the
[problem result](../../../problems/1d_sod/results/predictions/P1.25.png) for
all three output variables.

## Regenerate without training

From the repository root, after installing dependencies and retrieving LFS:

```bash
MPLBACKEND=Agg python scripts/promo_from_sod_results.py
# Optional: explicitly request only static output
MPLBACKEND=Agg python scripts/promo_from_sod_results.py --static-only
```

The script uses Agg, CPU inference, and two PyTorch threads. It checks
`free -m` before rendering and also respects a tighter cgroup v2 memory limit.
If effective available RAM drops below **2,500 MiB**, animation is skipped
and any stale GIF removed; the PNG strip remains. PNG plots are deliberately
small and figures are closed after saving. No CFD solves or training occur.

Regeneration overwrites this gallery's PNGs, arrays, and provenance file.
Source CFD data and model weights are only read. Conceptual images elsewhere
under `docs/assets/` are illustrative and are not outputs of this script.
